# Gaze tracker
> Gaze tracker tracks the gaze of a person and tell us whether it is looking to the camera or not.

In this project we created a gaze tracker using Computer Vision and Machine Learning algorithms, implementing the whole code with Matlab. This project was developed during the Computer Vision subject of the [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca).

## Installation

To run this project just install [Matlab](https://es.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) on your computer and then import it. 

> __Attention! Matlab is a paid software so you will require a valid license to run this project.__

## Usage example

In order to use this, first download the repository in your machine. Then start Matlab and import the project using `/src` folder as the root folder. Finally, run the code located in the file `/src/main.m`. 

The code is prepared to show us an example of a photo of a person who is looking at the camera. If you run the code you should see the following image.

/TODO: Add image

Also, the program recognizes images of people who are not looking at the camera and images with no people at all, as you can see below.

/TODO: Add images

In order to change the image to be processed just edit the corresponding line in `/src/main.m`. 

## Project structure

- `/src` contains the source code of the project. 
- `/data` contains the test images used in the project.
- `/Report.pdf` contains in depth explanation of the project and analysis of the performance.
